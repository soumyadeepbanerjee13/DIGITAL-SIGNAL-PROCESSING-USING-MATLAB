# DIGITAL-SIGNAL-PROCESSING-USING-MATLAB
### List of experiments that can be performed using matlab software:


(1) Generation of standard discrete sequences, viz. Unit 
impulse, unit step signal, unit ramp, exponential, sinusoidal 
and verify different arithmetic operations like amplitude 
scaling, time scaling, folding, time shifting, addition and 
multiplication.

(2) Linear convolution of two sequences using graphical 
methods and using commands and verification of the 
properties of convolution.

(3) Circular convolution of two sequences using graphical 
methods and using commands, comparison between linear 
and circular convolutions.

(4) Z-transform of various sequences and verification of the 
properties of Z-transform.

(5) Verification of the cyclic property of Twiddle Factors.

(6) Computation of DFTs and IDFTs using matrix 
multiplication and also using commands.

(7) Verifications of the different algorithms associated with 
filtering of long data sequences and Overlap-add and 
Overlap-save methods.

(8) Design a Butterworth digital IIR lowpass filter using 
impulse invariant transformation by taking T=1 second, to 
satisfy the given specifications.

(9) {a} Design a linear phase FIR lowpass filter using 
rectangular window by taking 7 samples of window 
sequence and with a cutoff frequency, ωc = 0.2π rad/sample.

{b} Design a linear phase FIR highpass filter using 
Hamming window, with a cutoff frequency, ωc = 0.8π 
rad/sample and N=7.

{c} Design a linear phase FIR bandpass filter to pass 
frequencies in the range 0.4π to 0.65π rad/sample by taking 
7 samples of Blackman window sequence.
  
(10) Perform linear convolution using TMS320C5416/6713 
Processor.
  
(11) Implement a half-adder and a full-adder using Xilinx FPGA.
  
(12) Noise removal using Moving-Average Filter
